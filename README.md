# Ticket Buddy

A practical reference repo that:

- Compares a Modular Monolith and a Microservices architecture for the same domain (Events, Users, Tickets) in .NET.
- Tracks an incremental migration of the backend to Elixir/BEAM (Phoenix + Ash), keeping messaging and observability intact.

## Migration status

Overall migration progress:

## Architectures in this repo

### Modular Monolith (.NET)

- Well-defined, in-repo modules hosted as a single application
- Asynchronous messaging between modules via MassTransit + RabbitMQ
- Recommended starting point for new products

Docs: [Modular Monolith](./ModularMonolith/README.md)

### Microservices (.NET)

- Distributed services communicating via RabbitMQ (MassTransit)
- Fully observable with OpenTelemetry and .NET Aspire
- Demonstrates patterns like YARP gateway and transactional outbox

Docs: [Microservices](./Microservices/README.md)

### Target Elixir/BEAM backend

- Phoenix umbrella with bounded contexts (Events, Users, Tickets)
- Ash resources + AshPostgres, Broadway (RabbitMQ), Oban, OpenTelemetry
- Gradual cutover while keeping APIs and message contracts stable

Plan: see `plans/concise_elixir_migration.md`

## Repository structure

- `ModularMonolith/` – .NET modular monolith solution
- `Microservices/` – .NET microservices solution
- `UI/` – React + Vite client
- `plans/` – Migration plan, checklist, and automation scripts
- `.github/workflows/` – CI and migration badge automation

## Key technologies

- .NET: ASP.NET Core, MassTransit, RabbitMQ, OpenTelemetry, .NET Aspire, YARP, Redis
- Frontend: React + Vite + Vitest
- Elixir (planned): Phoenix, Ash, AshPostgres, Broadway RabbitMQ, Oban, OpenTelemetry

## Observability

OpenTelemetry is used across services. The .NET stacks surface telemetry in the Aspire dashboard; the Elixir stack will export OTLP to the same collector.
