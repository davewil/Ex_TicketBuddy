## 10) Risks & mitigations

![Risks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davewil/Ex_TicketBuddy_ModularMonolith_To_Microservices/main/.github/badges/migration-progress.svg)

- [ ] SQL Server driver maturity â†’ migrate to Postgres early; confirm decision ([#52](https://github.com/davewil/Ex_TicketBuddy_ModularMonolith_To_Microservices/issues/52))
- [ ] Contract drift â†’ shared schemas + contract tests enforced ([#53](https://github.com/davewil/Ex_TicketBuddy_ModularMonolith_To_Microservices/issues/53))
- [ ] Trace gaps â†’ standardize headers; validate in dashboards ([#54](https://github.com/davewil/Ex_TicketBuddy_ModularMonolith_To_Microservices/issues/54))

## 11) Governance / tracking

![Governance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davewil/Ex_TicketBuddy_ModularMonolith_To_Microservices/main/.github/badges/migration-governance.svg)

- [x] Create GitHub labels for migration categories ([#55](https://github.com/davewil/Ex_TicketBuddy_ModularMonolith_To_Microservices/issues/55))
- [x] Create milestones per migration phase ([#1](https://github.com/davewil/Ex_TicketBuddy_ModularMonolith_To_Microservices/issues/1))
- [x] Create issues for each task (see plans/github_issues.ps1)
- [ ] Weekly progress review and status update ([#2](https://github.com/davewil/Ex_TicketBuddy_ModularMonolith_To_Microservices/issues/2))

Notes:

- Keep the .NET and Elixir stacks running side-by-side until cutover completes.
- Prefer AshJsonApi for fast CRUD; use Phoenix controllers to match bespoke responses.
- Keep contracts stable across HTTP and messaging; use contract tests for safety.
